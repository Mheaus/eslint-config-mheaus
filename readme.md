# No-Sweatâ„¢ Eslint and Prettier Setup
These are my settings for ESLint and Prettier from the original eslint-config-wesbos@0.0.19.

## What it does
* Lints JavaScript based on the latest standards
* Fixes issues and formatting errors with Prettier
* Lints + Fixes inside of html script tags
* Lints + Fixes React via eslint-config-airbnb
* You can see all the [rules here](https://github.com/mheaus/eslint-config-mheaus/blob/master/.eslintrc.js)

# Installing

## Local / Per Project Install

1. If you don't already have a `package.json` file, create one with `npm init`.

2. Then we need to install everything needed by the config:

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-mheaus
```

3. You can see in your package.json there are now a big list of devDependencies.

4. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project's directory (it should live where package.json does). Your `.eslintrc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "mheaus"
  ]
}
```

Tip: You can alternatively put this object in your `package.json` under the property `"eslintConfig":`. This makes one less file in your project.

5. You can add two scripts to your package.json to lint and/or fix:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
},
```

6. Now you can manually lint your code by running `npm run lint` and fix all fixable issues with `npm run lint:fix`. You probably want your editor to do this though.

## Global Install

I don't recommend this, but if you want, this is what you need to do.

1. First install everything needed:

```
npx install-peerdeps --global eslint-config-mheaus
```

2. Then you need to make a global `.eslintrc` file:

ESLint will look for one in your home directory

* `~/.eslintrc` for mac
* `C:\Users\username\.eslintrc` for windows

In your `.eslintrc` file, it should look like this:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "mheaus"
  ]
}
```

3. To use from the CLI, you can now run `eslint .` or configure your editor as we show next.

## Settings

If you'd like to overwrite eslint or prettier settings, you can add the rules in your `.eslintrc` file. The [ESLint rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) go directly under `"rules"` while [prettier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) go under `"prettier/prettier"`. Note that prettier rules overwrite anything in my config (trailing comma, and single quote), so you'll need to include those as well.

```js
{
  "extends": [
    "mheaus"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "no-console": 2,
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "error",
      {
        "trailingComma": "es5",
        "singleQuote": true,
        "printWidth": 120,
        "tabWidth": 8,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ ITS NOT WORKING

try upgrade your react-scripts package if you have one.

start fresh. Sometimes global modules can goof you up. This will remove them all.

```
npm remove --global eslint-config-mheaus babel-eslint eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react prettier
```

To do the above for local, omit the `--global` flag.

Then if you are using a local install, remove your `package-lock.json` file and delete the `node_modules/` directory.

Then follow the above instructions again.
